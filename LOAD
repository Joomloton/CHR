# Script to configure load balancing on MikroTik CHR

# Mark the traffic coming from the first network
/ip firewall mangle
add chain=input in-interface=ether1 action=mark-connection new-connection-mark=conn1
add chain=output connection-mark=conn1 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=route1

# Mark the traffic coming from the second network
add chain=input in-interface=ether2 action=mark-connection new-connection-mark=conn2
add chain=output connection-mark=conn2 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=route2

# Create two IP routes, each with its own routing mark
/ip route
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ether1 routing-mark=route1
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ether2 routing-mark=route2

# Add default route with equal cost to both gateways for load balancing
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ether1,ether2 check-gateway=ping

# The last command uses both ether1 and ether2 as default gateways with equal cost,
# which enables simple round-robin load balancing. The 'check-gateway=ping' option
# ensures that the route is only used if the gateway is reachable.

# Print the routing table to confirm configuration
/ip route print
